Hull Integrity
--------------

After choosing a hull size its time to cost it according to how effective it is against damaging effects like collisions, space "terrain" effects, and combat. The base cost is 1 point per MASS of the hull (mass is equal to hull size).

The hull costs additional points based on how many hull boxes it will have. The number of hull boxes represents a ship's structural integrity i.e. the amount of damage it can take before essential systems are compromised. The ship must have at least 25% of its overall mass in hull boxes, and each hull box costs an additional 2 points. The maximum amount of hull boxes---representing military grade materials, compartmentalization, redundancy, etc.---is 50% of overall mass. For example, a 32 MASS heavy cruiser hull would have 16 hull boxes and cost 64 points; 1 &times; the mass of the hull for 32 points, and 2 &times; the number of hull boxes for another 32 points.

Cargo and Passengers
--------------------

Better-than-average hull integrity limits the amount of mass available for [cargo and passenger space](CargoSpace). A hull is built with enough room to accommodate a crew and basic operations; but a hauler, tanker, science vessel, or passenger liner must have room for additional holds and quarters. For every 1-5% beyond average integrity the hull has, 8% less internal mass is available for cargo and passengers.

| Hull Integrity | Maximum Cargo Space
| -------------- | -------------------
| 25%            | 40% of hull mass
| 26-30%         | 32% of hull mass
| 31-35%         | 24% of hull mass
| 36-40%         | 16% of hull mass
| 41-45%         | 8% of hull mass
| 46-50%         | 0% of hull mass

Advanced Hull Integrity
-----------------------

At an increased cost hulls can be reinforced or insulated in such a way that more damage can be taken before essential systems are affected. Hulls with [advanced integrity](AdvancedHull) arrange their hull boxes in fewer rows than standard.
