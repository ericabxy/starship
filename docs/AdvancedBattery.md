Advanced Battery
----------------

Technologically advanced batteries use a cutting-edge beam technology that's effective at longer ranges and do more damage. The high-powered generators and focusing systems, however, are more expensive to produce and take up more mass than standard batteries.

### Range and Hit Rolls

| Range  | Class 1  | Class 2  | Class 3
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------
| 0-18″  | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3D6
| 18-36″ | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6
| 36-54″ | ---      | ---      | Roll 1D6

### Damage Rolls

Advanced batteries also deal more damage per hit scored. The roll results read as hits or misses according to [beam dice](BeamDice) rules, and each hit scores a random amount of damage determined by rolling another six-sided die.

| For every...      | Unscreened | Screen Level 1 | Screen Level 2
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------------
| 1, 2, or 3 rolled | ---        | ---            | ---
| 4 rolled          | 1D6 damage | ---            | ---
| 5 rolled          | 1D6 damage | 1D6 damage     | 1D6 damage
| 6 rolled          | 2D6 damage | 2D6 damage     | 1D6 damage

### Point Defense

Unlike [standard batteries](BeamBattery), advanced batteries cannot be fired in point-defense mode.

### Design Costs

The cutting-edge technology used in advanced beam batteries cost more in points and take up more mass on a ship.

| Type of System  | Mass | Cost
| --------------- | :--: | ----
| Class 1 Battery | 2    | 3 points + 2/arc
| Class 2 Battery | 5    | 5 points + 4/arc
| Class 3 Battery | 8    | 6 points + 5/arc
