Advanced Battery
----------------

A major development in weapons technology results in advanced main batteries that are more accurate and reliable at range.

The __long-range__ advanced battery deals damage at __one__ D6 in [beam dice](BeamDice) out to a range of __48&Prime;__. While it doesn't have damage fall-off like a standard battery does, it also doesn't do any more damage than normal to targets at close-range.

The __mid-range__ advanced battery deals __two__ D6 in beam damage at a range up to __24&Prime;__.

The __close-range__ advanced battery is experimental and not balanced for these rules yet.

| Class       | Range     | Dice
| -----       | -----     | ----
| Long-range  | 48&Prime; | 1D6
| Mid-range   | 24&Prime; | 2D6
| Close-range | 12&Prime; | 6D6

Point Defense Mode
------------------

ANY class of advanced battery may be used for point defense exactly as effective as a single [point defense system](PointDefenseSystem), but limited to the arcs it can normally fire through. In this mode it does NOT require a [FireCon](FireControlSystem) for targetting, but it cannot be used in anti-ship mode in the same turn it is used in defense mode and it ONLY rolls one point defense die regardless of class.

Design Procedure
----------------

| Arc of fire | Mass | Cost
| ----------- | :--: | ----
| 60&deg;     | 2    | 10 points
| 180&deg;    | 3    | 15 points
| 360&deg;    | 4    | 20 points

OLD RULES (we're going in a different direction)
----------------

Symbols:

<div class='ship-diagram'>
    <div class='advanced-battery advanced-battery--class-2'>
    </div>
    <div class='advanced-battery advanced-battery--class-3'>
    </div>
    <div class='advanced-battery advanced-battery--class-1'>
    </div>
</div>

Rolling to Hit
--------------

| Range      | Class 1  | Class 2  | Class 3
| -----      | -------  | -------  | -------
| **0-12″**  | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3D6
| **12-24″** | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6
| **24-36″** | ---      | ---      | Roll 1D6

Rolling for Damage
------------------

First determine the number of hits scored:

| Hit Roll | Unscreened   | One Screen   | Two Screens
| :------: | ----------   | ----------   | -----------
| 1-3      | ---          | ---          | ---
| 4        | **One** hit  | ---          | ---
| 5        | **One** hit  | **One** hit  | **One** hit
| 6        | **Two** hits | **Two** hits | **One** hit

For _each hit_ scored, roll another D6 and consult the following table to determine the damage dealt.

| Damage roll
| ----------- |
| 1-2         | **One** damage point
| 3-4         | **Two** damage points
| 5-6         | **Three** damage points

Point Defense Mode
------------------

Much like [standard batteries](MainBattery), advanced batteries can operate in point defense mode, however ANY class of advanced battery can be fired in this way (not just Class-1). It rolls for hits as a SINGLE [point defense system](PointDefenseSystem) using the unmodified table, and does NOT require a [FireCon](FireControlSystem) dedicated to its target.

| Every **1**, **2**, or **3** rolled | No hits
| Every **4** or **5** rolled         | **One** fighter or missile killed
| Every **6** rolled                  | **Two** fighters or missiles killed

An advanced battery used in this mode cannot by used in anti-ship mode in the same turn. It follows the same rules as a normal PDS against tougher enemies like [missile craft](MissileCraft), [heavy-type fighter groups](FighterGroup#heavy-fighters), etc..

Needle Mode
-----------

To be determined once Advanced Fire Control systems are added.

Area Defense Mode
-----------------

To be determined once Advanced Fire Control systems are added.

Design Procedure
----------------

| Battery       | Bearing      | Mass     | Points Cost
| -------       | -------      | ----     | -----------
| Class-1       | 6-arcs       | 2        | 6
| Class-2       | 3-arcs       | 3        | 9
| Class-3       | 1-arc        | 5        | 15
| Class-4       | 1-arc        | 8        | 24
