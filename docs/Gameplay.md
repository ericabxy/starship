Gameplay Sequence
-----------------

### Movement Phase

__Moving Starships:__ To begin each turn, players alternate [moving their ships](ShipMovement) one at a time, starting with the player who has the MOST individual ships in play. No ship is required to make any maneuvers at this time, but any with a current velocity must at least drift along that vector.

__Moving Small Craft:__ Small craft use a different movement system and are moved after all ship movement is complete. Players again alternate, starting with the player who has the most GROUPS of small craft in play. A single [missile](MissileCraft) or a full [fighter group](FighterGroup) each count as 1 for this determination.

Whether small craft can remain stationary in this phase is according their individual rules. For instance fighter groups can move 0&Prime; if desired, but certain missiles must move a minimum distance each turn.

Fighters and missiles declare their attack runs in this phase, the results of which are determined later.

### Firing Phase

__Firing Offensive Weaponry:__ Players now take turns choosing and resolving starship weapons fire. Starting with the player who has the FEWEST individual ships in play, each player alternates choosing one of their ships and firing on any desired targets as outlined in individual weapons rules. [Point defense](PointDefenseSystem) fire is resolved at this time as well.

__Firing Point-defense and Resolving Attack Runs:__ Any ship subject to attack runs by fighters or missiles can fire point defense systems at their attackers. After each individual ship has finished firing all offensive weapons AND firing on their attackers, any surviving fighters or missiles resolve their attack runs.

__Remaining Small Craft:__ Any small craft that did not declare an attack run earlier can make attacks in this phase, either to attempt to shoot down enemy missiles or dogfight enemy fighter groups.
