Cargo Space
-----------

H
: Hold space for cargo

P
: Passenger accommodations

S
: Science staff and lab facilities

T
: Troop accommodations

FTL
: Faster-than-light towing capacity

A "merchant" or civilian ship with only 10% mass available for other systems has a total of 40% dedicated to cargo space. If the ship takes damage, cargo space is lost in proportion to the hull boxes that are crossed off. To make this easy to calculate, divide the total cargo space into portions according to the number of hull rows the ship has. Every time the ship loses enough hull to reach a [damage threshold](ThresholdPoints), one portion of the cargo space is lost and must be crossed off the ship diagram.

Cargo and passenger carrying capacity leave less room for the reinforcement and compartmentalization needed to create "strong" hulls, to the more cargo space a ship has, the fewer hull boxes it can have. For example,

Faster-than-light Tug Capacity
------------------------------

FTL tugs are designed with oversize [faster-than-light drive](FasterThanLightDrive) systems in order to "tow" non-FTL-capable ships through FTL space. They work a lot like "merchant" ships in that their towing capacity is represented by special hold space (and are thus limited in hull strength and capacity for mounting other ship systems). While normal FTL capability costs no mass and a number of points equal to overall mass, FTL towing takes up 1 cargo space per 5 mass of towing capacity and costs 5 points. As usual with cargo space, only 40% of overall mass can be taken up by FTL towing capacity.

Like other cargo space, towing capacity is lost at a rate proportional to hull rows, so a mass 50 tug that's taken 3 damage will only be able to tow 15 mass of ships through FTL (down from 20 mass).

*[FTL]: Faster Than Light

### Examples

- Mass 50 FTL Tug
- 1 &times; FTL drive system (0 mass, 50 points)
- 50 &times; FTL towing capacity (20 mass, 100 points)
- 12 &times; Hull integrity (0 mass, 24 points)
- 5 mass available for weapons/systems

- Mass 60 FTL Tender
- 1 &times; FTL drive system (0 mass, 60 points)
- 60 &times; FTL towing capacity (24 mass, 120 points)
- 15 &times; Hull integrity (0 mass, 30 points)
- 6 mass available for weapons/systems

Notes
-----

Merchant ship designs in _More Thrust_ round UP the 10% mass available for systems and thus round DOWN the 40% mass available for cargo space. I take this to mean a ship MUST reserve 10% of its mass for systems (rounded up), and can pack whatever is needed in the remaining 40% (rounded down) including additional systems.

The 25% of mass in hull boxes is also rounded UP for merchant ships. I take this to mean the 25% hull integrity (rounded up) is indeed a minimum.

- Armed Merchantman: mass 36, systems 4, cargo 14
- Medium Tug: mass 32, systems 4, cargo 12
- Free Trader: mass 10, systems 1, cargo 4
