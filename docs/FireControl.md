Fire Control
------------

Fire control (FireCon) systems allow a ship to target and fire weapon systems. Per turn, one FireCon must be dedicated to each target the ship wishes to fire upon. The FireCon can target for one or more weapons to fire in that turn, but can't be used to designate any other targets. This effectively limits e.g. a ship with one FireCon to firing upon only one target during the firing phase, but it is free to fire any and all weapons it can bring to bear on that target.

Under certain circumstances, one FireCon must be dedicated to a specific targeting task. For instance, to fire [needle beams](NeedleBeams) at a subsystem mounted on an enemy ship, one FireCon must be dedicated to that subsystem as a target. Any number of needle beams can be brought to bear on this one target, but the FireCon cannot designate any other target systems OR ships on this turn.
