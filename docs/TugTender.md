Faster-than-light Tug/Tender System
-----------------------------------

This system is designed to extend a ship's FTL drive fields around another ship in order to "carry" it through FTL space.

Tug capacity is limited just like [cargo space](CargoSpace) to a maximum of 40% hull mass, and a hull with higher-than-average integrity (more than 25%) reduces this maximum as well.

Each 2 mass of hull of FTL tug space grants 5 mass of FTL towing capacity and costs 10 points. Thus, a MASS 50 Tug with 20 space dedicated could tow up a ship of up to MASS 50 through FTL space, and a MASS 60 Tender with 24 space could carry up to 60 mass of ships through.
