Needle System
--------------

A needle is a special battery designed to target and knock-out individual ship systems. Targeting a ship system requires the use of one [FireCon](FireControlSystem), which cannot be used to fire other weapons this turn, but CAN be used to fire other needles at the SAME target system this turn. For each needle system fired, roll on D6.

| Roll results | Effect
| ------------ | ------
| 1-4          | No effect
| 5            | One damage point
| 6            | One damage point AND target system knocked-out
