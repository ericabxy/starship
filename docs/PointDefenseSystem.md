Point Defense System
--------------------

A point defense system (PDS) is an array of short-range turrets designed to target fast-moving, lightly-armored craft like fighters and missiles.

Mandatory Point Defense Systems (experimental)
-------------------------------

Due to balance issues in the rules for fighter combat, efforts have been made to level the playing field.

### Normal batteries as point defense

Class-1 batteries were enhanced with a limited point defense capability, making it somewhat more practical to design them even into larger ships with room for more powerful batteries. The dual role makes fleets more likely to have at least moderate fighter and missile defense, making it less likely an opponent can win simply by swarming with fighters.

### Mandatory or "free" point defense

Requiring a ship of a certain size to mount a minimum amount of PDS would ensure a fleet always has at least adequate fighter/missile defense available. It might even be good to give a ship FREE point defense systems based on size.

### Removing dedicated point defense systems

It may be beneficial to treat standard batteries as identical to point defense systems, either removing PDS from the design process entirely or treating them identically to Class-1 batteries.

### Point defense fire control systems

The game could introduce a new system similar to the Area Defense FireCon. A Point Defense Fire Control (PDFC) system would allow most of the anti-ship batteries to operate in point defense mode, as long as the ship was being attacked within the battery's arc of fire. A PDFC might even allow the smallest Class-1 batteries to operate exactly as a standard PDS would.
