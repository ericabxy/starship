Standard and Advanced Technology
--------------------------------

Advanced versions of certain ship systems are provided to allow for "tech level" differences between major players in this system. The difference between standard systems and advanced systems are designed not to be simple "power-ups"; each advanced technology is designed to be fundamentally different in some way.

The advanced systems allow you to flavor the field of battle with players that have a slight or distinct edge over the others. Some standard Earthlings might be waging war against an alien enemy with extremely maneuverable gravity drives, for example.
