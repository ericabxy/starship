Advanced Screens
----------------

Advanced screens employ a type of "smart" or [reactive armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour) designed to intercept and deflect physical projectiles. This makes them effective against weapons that normally ignore or punch through less advanced screens.

The alternate icon above is designed to make it easier to tell the difference between standard and advanced screen generators if you are drawing the symbol by hand with pen and paper.

Against Batteries
-----------------

Advanced screens work as normal [defensive screens](ScreenGenerator) against [beam batteries](MainBattery) and [advanced batteries](AdvancedBattery).

Against Submuntions
-------------------

Advanced screens affect submunitions as if they were beams, taking fewer hits depending on screen level.

**Submunitions damage against advanced screens:**

| Results                                    | Screen Level 1        | Screen Level 2
| -------                                    | --------------------- | --------------
| Every **1**, **2**, **3**, or **4** rolled | No effect             | No effect
| Every **5** rolled                             | **One** damage point  | **One** damage point
| Every **6** rolled                             | **Two** damage points | **One** damage point

Against Torpedoes
-----------------

Advanced screens do not affect the hit rate of [torpedoes](TorpedoSystem), but they do reduce the damage inflicted by successful hits.

**Torpedo damage against advanced screens:**

| Result       | Screen Level 1            | Screen Level 2
| ------------ | --------------            | --------------
| **1** rolled | No effect                 | No effect
| **2** rolled | **One** damage point      | No effect
| **3** rolled | **Two** damage points     | **One** damage point
| **4** rolled | **Three** damage points   | **Two** damage points
| **5** rolled | **Four** damage points    | **Three** damage points
| **6** rolled | **Five** damage points    | **Four** damage points

Against Railguns
-----------------
Advanced screens reduce the chance of taking double damage from a [railgun](RailgunSystem#advanced-screens) hit.

**Railgun damage against advanced screens:**

| Screen Level 1 | 1-4 Rolled       | 5-6 Rolled
| Screen Level 2 | 1-5 Rolled       | 6 Rolled
| :------------: | ---------------- | ----------
| Class 1        | **One** point    | **Two** points
| Class 2        | **Two** points   | **Four** points
| Class 3        | **Three** points | **Six** points
| Class 4        | **Four** points  | **Eight** points
