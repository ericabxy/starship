Missile Craft
-------------

Missiles are small, fast, unmanned spacecraft with combat payloads and onboard A.I. that can pursue and attack capital ships.

Launching
---------

A missile is launched just like a fighter.

Moving
------

Move up to 18" each turn, within 60 degrees of the missile's current heading, for up to THREE turns. 

Attacking
---------

If any ships end their movement within 3&Prime; of an enemy missile, the missile will attack the nearest enemy ship. The ship's [point defense](PointDefenseSystem) systems may attempt to shoot down the missile before it hits.

The missile is heavily armored and is treated as if it had Grade--2 defensive screens.

| Roll results | Effect
| ------------ | ------
| 1-4          | No effect
| 5-6          | Missile destroyed

If the missile system survives any and all point defense fire, it hits the target ship and deals 2d6 damage, ignoring standard [screens](ScreenGenerator) but being affected by any [advanced screens](AdvancedScreen) defending the ship.

Design Costs
------------

A missile system is fitted to the hull and contains 1 flight of missiles. Once it has launched, must be crossed off the SSD for the rest of the battle. Each system costs 6 points and takes up 2 mass.

Probes
------

Instead of a warhead, missiles can be designed to carry other systems even for non-combat purposes. For example, a sensor platform that can get close to ship or other body and send back data that the launching ship couldn't sense at that range; or a message buoy or beacon to be intercepted by another ship or discovered by another ship.

### Dummy Probe

A dummy probe emits a signature that makes it register on passive sensors as an ESCORT size ship. It remains in play until it is actively scanned, revealing its true nature and removing it from the table.

Notes
-----

The rules for missile craft are meant to be an interesting single- and multi-turn projectile weapon, as well as provide options for settings that don't include "fighter"-size craft---a sci-fi concept that is considered unrealistic or undesirable in some cases!
