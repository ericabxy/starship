Missile Craft
-------------

_Under Construction:_ This weapon system is in-development, combining similar and overlapping mechanics of the _More Thrust_ missile, fighter groups, the _Fleet Book 1_ missile system, and later refinements to all of the above.

Missiles are small, fast, unmanned spacecraft with combat payloads and onboard A.I. used to pursue and damage capital ships.

### Launching

A missile is launched in a similar way to a fighter group. Immediately after launch it can move up to 18&Prime; in a direction within 180&deg; of the direction the launching ship is facing.

### Moving

The missile can stay in flight up to three turns including the turn it launched and moved. During each subsequent turn it can move an additional 18&Prime; in a direction within 60&Prime; of its current heading.

### Attacking

The missile makes an attack run on the nearest enemy ship within 3 &Prime; of it. At this point the ship's [point defense](PointDefenseSystem) systems can attempt to shoot it down before it strikes true.

Missiles are heavily armored and treated as having Level-2 defensive screens when it comes to PDS fire.

| Roll results | Effect
| ------------ | ------
| 1-4          | No effect
| 5-6          | Missile destroyed

If the missile system survives any and all point defense fire, it hits the target ship and deals 2d6 damage, ignoring standard [screens](ScreenGenerator) but being affected by any [advanced screens](AdvancedScreen) defending the ship.

Design Costs
------------

A missile system is fitted to the hull and contains 1 flight of missiles. Once it has launched, must be crossed off the SSD for the rest of the battle. Each system costs 6 points and takes up 2 mass.

Probes
------

Instead of a warhead, missiles can be designed to carry other systems even for non-combat purposes. For example, a sensor platform that can get close to ship or other body and send back data that the launching ship couldn't sense at that range; or a message buoy or beacon to be intercepted by another ship or discovered by another ship.

### Dummy Probe

A dummy probe emits a signature that makes it register on passive sensors as an ESCORT size ship. It remains in play until it is actively scanned, revealing its true nature and removing it from the table.

Notes
-----

The rules for missile craft are meant to be an interesting single- and multi-turn projectile weapon, as well as provide options for settings that don't include "fighter"-size craft---a sci-fi concept that is considered unrealistic or undesirable in some cases!
