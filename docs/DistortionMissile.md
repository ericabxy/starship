Spatial Distortion Missiles
---------------------------

Advanced missile system that causes area-of-effect damage at point of detonation by entering [faster-than-light](FasterThanLightDrive) space. Placed up to 18&prime; from the firing ship in a 60&deg; or 180&deg; arc. [Point defense systems](PointDefenseSystem), fighters, and other defenses within 3&Prime; (also see Area Defense Systems) can attempt to "kill" the missiles before they detonate---count it as three craft as if it were a fighter group.

The missiles are small craft, but they have condensed mass as a payload and try to coordinate themselves to generate the most damaging spatial distortion effects on FTL entry. For each ship within 1&Prime; of the detonation point, roll a number of D6 equal to the number of missiles that survived point defense fire and deal the result in damage points to the ship. Then reduce the amount of dice by __one__ and repeat the roll for ships within 2&Prime; of the detonation point---unless there are no dice left. Reduce by __one__ again and repeat for ships within 3&Prime; if applicable.
