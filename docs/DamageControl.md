| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------
| 1-3 rolled | ---             | ---             | ---
| 4 rolled   | ---             | ---             | System repaired
| 5 rolled   | ---             | System repaired | System repaired
| 6 rolled   | System repaired | System repaired | System repaired

Damage control factors are an integral feature of a ship's crew and internal systems. They need not be marked on a ship diagram and aren't rolled for during threshhold checks.
