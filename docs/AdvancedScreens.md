Advanced Screens
----------------

Advanced screens employ a type of "smart" or [reactive armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour) designed to intercept and deflect physical projectiles. This makes them effective against weapons that normally ignore or punch through less advanced screens.

Against Batteries
-----------------

Advanced screens work as normal [defensive screens](ScreenGenerator) against [beam batteries](BeamBattery) and [advanced batteries](AdvancedBattery).

Against Submuntions
-------------------

Advanced screens affect submunitions as if they were beams, taking fewer hits depending on screen level.

**Submunitions damage against advanced screens:**

| Results                    | Screen Level 1        | Screen Level 2
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------
| Every 1, 2, 3, or 4 rolled | None                  | None
| Every 5 rolled             | **One** damage point  | **One** damage point
| Every 6 rolled             | **Two** damage points | **One** damage point

Against Torpedoes
-----------------

Advanced screens do not affect the hit rate of [torpedoes](TorpedoSystem), but they do reduce the damage inflicted by successful hits.

**Torpedo damage against advanced screens:**

| Result       | Screen Level 1     | Screen Level 2
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------
| **1** rolled | None               | None
| **2** rolled | **One** point      | None
| **3** rolled | **Two** points     | **One** point
| **4** rolled | **Three** points   | **Two** points
| **5** rolled | **Four** points    | **Three** points
| **6** rolled | **Five** points    | **Four** points

Against Railguns
-----------------
Advanced screens reduce the chance of taking double damage from a [railgun](RailgunSystem#advanced-screens) hit.

**Railgun damage against advanced screens:**

| Screen Level 1 | 1-4 Rolled       | 5-6 Rolled
| Screen Level 2 | 1-5 Rolled       | 6 Rolled
| :------------: | ---------------- | ----------
| Class 1        | **One** point    | **Two** points
| Class 2        | **Two** points   | **Four** points
| Class 3        | **Three** points | **Six** points
| Class 4        | **Four** points  | **Eight** points
